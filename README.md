obfuscators for anything needing to touch disk (download n exec, file share's etc).
offers a degree of evasion from signature based detection.

```
 gen-obfuscated.pl 
 creates an obfuscated vbs/vba downloader 

 Converts a character to it's ascii code value. Works as a 
 simple vb-s/a obfuscator specificly for shell command 
 execution. The current examples focus on powershell based 
 attacks but is not limited to them.

```

```

ps-obfuscator.ps1
Generates ofuscated vbs downloaders, also has functions with malware 
type behavior. Designed to be used with an implant.

Originally started out as gen-obfuscated which was written in perl. I wanted to 
rewrite that perl script from scratch but instead kinda did it in powershell.
This was due to having the implants being able to generate obfuscated payloads
on there own. 

Not all of the functions from gen-obfuscated have been moved over and some 
of this stuff is original and was never on the perl script to begin with.
The code here has been removed from the implants for stand alone use.
And are tailored for the idea of "user initiated" lateral movement inside 
a network. Which should help remove the need of exploits.

```


```
script-obfuscator.ps1

Originally intended to work on Invoke-Mimikatz when it needs to be copied to disk.
Since I saw the ps1 getting flaged by AV, found this technique should work on getting 
most ps1 scripts around AV.

launcher.ps1 
Is needed to execute the obfuscated code generated by script-obfuscator.ps1. 
The launcher needs to be run in memory since it is vulnerable to detection.
